# Steppers Vs Servos
Welcome to the Servos vs. Steppers Repository. Delve into the world of motor dynamics, as we navigate through the nuances of servo and stepper motors. Gain insights on selection, applications, and unleash the power of precision in robotics and electronics.

## Stepper Motors
Stepper motors are precise electromechanical devices that convert digital signals into incremental rotation, delivering precise control over angular position. Composed of multiple coils, they move in discrete steps, making them ideal for applications requiring accurate positioning, such as 3D printers, CNC machines, and robotics.

In other words, we can lean on Stepper motors in handling precises movements and not into speed of rotation.

Also, Stepper motors are mostly known for their "Power Lifting" ability, as they are able of carrying weight while rotating.

Here, I want to talk about the "Torque" property, so basically Torque in motors refers to the rotational force or moment of force that a motor can exert. It is a measure of the motor's ability to generate rotational motion and is typically represented in Newton-meters (Nm) or ounce-inches. So, higher torque values signify greater rotational force, crucial for overcoming resistance or inertia in mechanical systems.

To make it more simple, let's consider the torque as the capabilty of the motor in holding weights. Below, this image illustrates what the torque is ( Do not worry, most of the times we don't have to calculate the torque of a motor as it is given among the specs of motors when buying)
